  I am a computer scientist (M.Sc.) from Karlsruhe, Germany. I am generally interested in programming, especially in Java, Python, and Rust.
  I am also a Researcher at KIT in the domain of Software Architecture Documentation and Natural Language Programming (NLP).
  At my job, I am also resposible for teaching students in different areas around Programming, Software Engineering, and Research. You can find more on <a href="https://are.ipd.kit.edu/people/jan-keim/">my institute page</a>.

#An additional info freetext section is optional at the bottom of the page - can be text or HTML
additionalinfo: |
  <strong>Java</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. Additionally, I worked with the <strong>Eclipse</strong> RCP and Maven Tycho. <br/><br/>
  <strong>EMF/Ecore</strong>: In my research, I also worked a lot with EMF/Ecore and similar MDSD tools. <br/><br/>
  <strong>Rust</strong>: I did some Rust and have most basic knowledge. However, I would not call me an expert or really advanced developer.
