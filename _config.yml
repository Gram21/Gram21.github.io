additionalinfo: |
  <strong>Java</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. Additionally, I worked with the <strong>Eclipse</strong> RCP and Maven Tycho. <br/><br/>
  <strong>EMF/Ecore</strong>: In my research, I also worked a lot with EMF/Ecore and similar MDSD tools. <br/><br/>
  <strong>Rust</strong>: I did some Rust and have most basic knowledge. However, I would not call me an expert or really advanced developer.
