I am a computer science student at KIT in Karlsruhe, Germany.
I am interested in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) programming and general [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).

As a hobby I take part in playing [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) together with the teams [KITCTF](https://kitctf.de/) and [Eat, Sleep, Pwn, Repeat](https://twitter.com/EatSleepPwnRpt).
