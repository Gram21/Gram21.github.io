I am a computer scientist (M.Sc.) from Karlsruhe, Germany. I am generally interested in programming, especially in Java, Python, and Rust.
I am also a Researcher at KIT in the domain of Software Architecture Documentation and Natural Language Programming (NLP).
At my job, I am also resposible for teaching students in different areas around Programming, Software Engineering, and Research. You can find more on [the website of the research group I am working for](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu/staff_Keim_Jan.php).
